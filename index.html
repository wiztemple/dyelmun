 <h3><a href="#">Credit card giants sued over chip readers</a></h3>
 <img src="credit.jpg" alt="" /><p>A judge is allowing small businesses to sue the major credit card companies for forcing them to adopt chip readers
 at the checkout counter -- a case that could become a multi-billion-dollar class action.The lawsuit takes aim at the nationwide
 upgrade to chip-based credit cards, an awkward rollout that's been annoying for stores and shoppers.
 Customers have found the system confusing. And it's much slower to process transactions than the old magnetic stripe cards.
 To business owners, it's a raw deal.They were forced to upgrade to expensive machines that reduce fraud but don't
 eliminate it. If they don't upgrade, they're penalized by the credit card companies. Stores that don't install chip
 readers are on the hook whenever a shopper swipes a stolen credit card-- a burden previously shouldered by banks.</P>
